// Traditional JavaScript uses functions and prototype-based inheritance to build up
// reusable components, but this may feel a bit awkward to programmers more comfortable
// with an object-oriented approach, where classes inherit functionality and objects
// are built from these classes. Starting with ECMAScript 2015, also known as ECMAScript 6,
// JavaScript programmers will be able to build their applications using this object-oriented
// class-based approach.

// Type equivalence

// TypeScript is a structural type system. When we compare two different types,

// However, when comparing types that have *private* or *protected* members,
// we treat these types differently. For two types to be considered compatible,
// if one of them has a private member, then the other must have a private member
// that originated in the same declaration. The same applies to protected members.

class EmployeeEx {
  private name: string = "";
}

class AnimalEx {
  private name: string = "";

let anEmployeeEx = new EmployeeEx();

// because each of these classes has a private property that don't originate from the same
// declaration, they are not compatible:
// anEmployeeEx = anAnimalEx; // error TS2322: Type 'AnimalEx' is not assignable to type 'EmployeeEx'

// Read-Only Properties
